# Hand Gesture Recognition with Flask

This project is a simple Flask-based web application for capturing and processing hand gestures using **Mediapipe**. It allows users to upload images or videos, detect hand gestures, and save them into a dataset for further processing or model training. The system also visualizes the detected hand landmarks on images.
